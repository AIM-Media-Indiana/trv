** USAGE

Starting

On Linux (and other OSes using Bash shell), in this folder:

./run

On Windows, go to the src directory and run main.py

---
Available modes:
* Panning
* Zooming
* Information
* PseudoRHI

In the panning mode, you can only pan the map by dragging it with mouse.

In zooming mode, you can zoom in/out by clicking or dragging.
Left click - zoom in, right click - zoom out.
In the information mode, you can get information about a single data bin by clicking on it.

You can export the current image display into formats supported by PIL.

Also, you can create pseudoRHI's from desired azimuths (Only Nexrad Level II and HDF5).

See also a demonstration video to get an idea of the user interface and how to use it:

-----
** REQUIREMENTS

* Python 2.x, preferrably 2.7. May work with older versions but YMMV. 
* Tkinter
* Python Imaging Library, can be its Pillow fork. (The development machine uses the Pillow fork,
as it is distributed with newer Ubuntu distributions).
* H5PY

I recommend to have at least 1 GB of RAM
-----
** SUPPORTED FORMATS

* Nexrad Level III - products 94, 99, 157, 161, 162, 163, 165
* Nexrad Level II - all products
    NB! Files received from NCDC archives are initially compressed in GZip. You need to unpack them
    first before viewing in this application.
* HDF5 - Polar volumes(PVOL, H5rad 1.2) only. Supported products: DBZ, VRAD, KDP, PHIDP, RHOHV, WRAD, ZDR

** PLEASE NOTE

* Program will appear to freeze in operations such as loading Level 2 data or downloading an URL.
This is not an error, as only 1 thread is used at given time.
* Range folded bins in NEXRAD data are discarded

Used materials:

Map contours - Natural Earth - http://www.naturalearthdata.com
Font used on rendered images - DejaVu Sans Condensed - http://dejavu-fonts.org
Module nexrad_level2.py: pyART - http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/
Example file in /data directory: NEXRAD Level 2 arhiiv(See note above!) - www.ncdc.noaa.gov/nexradinv/

-------
Notes:

* On first run, the program will start longer and use more memory as the files containing the
map contours are compiled into pyc. It will be faster on subsequent runs.
* At places things are quite raw. There may be inaccuracies(kindly notify me if you find one).
